I dunno, review the year or something. Look through the past year's monthly reviews and figure out what's going on this year.

Make a new yearly goals document by copying the old one over and seeing what needs copying, and what needs removing.

Look at [[2025 Plan]], [[2026 Plan]] and [[Repeating Tasks]] as well.
And then edit this template at some point for the following years.
